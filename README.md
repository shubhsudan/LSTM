# LSTM

This Project explains how to apply LSTM on a IMDB Dataset having 2 columns Review and Sentiment and 50k Rows.
We import libraries like nltk.download('all')
Spacy
LSTM and many more

We initialize by preprocessing the text data as in cleaning the data-tokenizing,lemmatizing,removing punctuations,stopwords, html url and removing whitespace between the text.

We have recreated the data and also cleaned the Abbreviated Data.
It has 2 columns ABR and S meaning Abbreviated Review and Sentiment.

Main issues is running the process-takes 15 minutes for 50k rows.
